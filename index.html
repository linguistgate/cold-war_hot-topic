<h3 id="orgheadline1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> The Cold War</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
The Cold War between the Western Bloc (the United States, NATO, and others) and the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and satellite states) was a period of political and military tension. It lasted approximately from the end of the Second World War to the early 1990s following the collapse of the Soviet Union.
</p>

<p>
There are many entry points for middle school students to approach topics in the Cold War from a humanistic perspective. We think one possibility with the Cold War is to talk about how there are many different kinds of conflicts; not all are fought with weapons. In particular, there can be "proxy" competitions, and skillful use of propaganda can be used to sway sides and influence opinion. The Space Race conducted by the United States and the Soviet Union is a good example of a proxy competition.
</p>

<p>
From this proxy "war," students can connect how space missions are <i>both</i> scientific <i>and</i> ideological. They make statements about goals and ambitions, but they are fundamentally scientific pursuits. There is a wealth of possibility for illustrating how geopolitical concerns intersect with scientific progress, for example.
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="orgheadline2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Researching a space mission</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
In this project, students research a particular space launch. The particular launch can be drawn from any point during the Cold War, ranging from the Russian launch of Sputnik, the Mercury/Gemini/Apollo launches, or Vostok/Soyuz cosmonauts (as well as the Space Shuttle program). Students will need to familiarize themselves with
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the mission objective</li>
<li>the insignia of the crew</li>
<li>details of the mission, including
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the names of crew members</li>
<li>any insignia or artwork</li>
<li>mission accomplishments and failures</li>
</ul></li>
<li>possible political motivations for the mission</li>

<h3 id="orgheadline3"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Project</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
To make the project more feasible for its short length, each student group will be <i>given</i> a particular space mission. This limits student choice, of course, and in a larger project, students could undertake choosing their own.
</p>

<p>
With this background, students will propose a new space mission based on the one they have been given.
</p>

<p>
They can choose to be employees of SpaceX, NASA, the China National Space Administration (CNSA), or others (India!). The proposal has two facets:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>understanding that missions are tightly executed, well-planned events that feature massive system planning and specific individual contributions</li>
<li>understanding that a mission's objective often has a political background</li>

<h2 id="orgheadline6"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Assessment</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
For this project, students will create a <b>mission dossier</b> consisting of the following components:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Artwork and insignia for the mission</li>
<li>A slogan the defines the mission's scope and ambition</li>
<li>Detailed information about the rocket type, mission objectives, crew member roles, etc.</li>
<li>A short news release that sets out the mission details for the public</li>
</ul>

<p>
Individual students will be responsible for one component of this project. The important thing is that the mission "hangs together"; choice of artwork and slogan should fit in with mission objectives, for example.
</p>

<p>
The dossier will be built using a Wiki template. This will have been started by the teacher, but students are free to modify the template within reason.

The primary responsibility of the teacher is to facilitate each group dissolving itself into individual roles and to ensure that the roles are equally divided. During building the dossier, the teacher circulates constantly, giving appropriate and directed feedback, helping students who are stuck, and encouraging groups to meet up if there are impasses or the cohesion of the mission seems insufficiently tight.

Students will be able to choose their role within the project; the type of mission they'd like to describe; and all details of their mission.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How are parents invited into the various processes of the project?</li>
</ul>
<p>
Parents or grandparents are invited to share their experiences during the Cold War. A lot of parents or grandparents living in the United States vividly remember the launch of Sputnik, for example, and often describe a mix of fear and wonder associated with the event.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How are community members or experts used in planning, critique or revision of student work?</li>
</ul>
<p>
Because of how short the project is, I'd likely not schedule a community member to be present, but in an extended project, it's possible to find a member of the space community, a rocket scientist, or a journalist who reports of tech subjects to come to the class and give valuable perspective on their role.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How might students, parents, community members and experts be included in assessment?</li>

At the conclusion of the project, an open document with student, parent, and teacher feedback will be filled out. This gives each party room to talk about ways to improve the project and what really worked.

<li>How will all students find moments of challenge in this work?</li>

To make the mission cohere, students need to make sure that all members are on the same page. They must agree on a mission objective, and this forms the basis for their individual contributions.

It's kind of a mini-illustration of the military-industrial complex, in one sense. It makes students aware that working for a company, even as an engineer, is an activity that's embedded in a lot of other issues happening at the time. Companies and missions don't happen in isolation: they're often responses to geopolitical realities.
